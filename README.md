# TROPIX - Unix-like Operating System

## Description
TROPIX (pronounced "Trópix") is a multi-user, multitasking operating system inspired by UNIX® philosophy. Originally developed at the Núcleo de Computação Eletrônica of the Universidade Federal do Rio de Janeiro (NCE/UFRJ), it traces its roots back to the PLURIX project initiated between 1982 and 1986 for the PEGASUS computer, based on MOTOROLA 68010/20 processors. Over the years, TROPIX has evolved and adapted to INTEL processors since 1994, becoming a versatile platform for educational use, software development, and serving as a web server.
TROPIX is distributed freely under the GNU Public License (GPL).
IT IS NOT MAINTEINED ANYMORE.

## System Characteristics
1. **Distribution:** Available on 3½" floppy disks or as a CD-ROM image.
2. **Utilities:** Includes basic UNIX tools, an ANSI "C" development environment, TCP/IP networking support, and essential clients/servers such as "telnet", "ftp", and "www".
3. **Internationalization:** Fully supports the ISO-8859-1 (Latin-1) character set, ensuring complete language compatibility across its tools and documentation in Portuguese.
4. **Compatibility:** Supports a wide range of hardware including FAT/NTFS file systems, CD-ROMs, ZIP drives, USB drives, and features support for EXT2 and V7FS file systems.

## Hardware Requirements (suitable for running in a virtual machine)
1. **Processor:** Intel 486/PENTIUM or equivalent.
2. **Memory:** Minimum 8 MB RAM; 16 MB recommended for running the X-Window System (exact memory requirements may vary).
3. **Supported Devices:** IDE/ATA/SATA hard drives, SCSI devices like ZIP drives and CD-ROMs; Ethernet network adapters and modems; parallel ports for printers; USB ports for mice and pen drives; digital audio output.
